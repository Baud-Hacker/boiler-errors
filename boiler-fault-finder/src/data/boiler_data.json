      "troubleshooting": "Safety first: before doing anything isolate the boiler electrically by switching it off at the external isolator or the household fuse box and wait for hot components to cool. Do not work on gas components, the flue, or inside the sealed combustion chamber — those tasks require a Gas Safe / licensed technician. Use insulated tools and avoid working in wet conditions. If you are unsure at any point stop and call a qualified heating engineer. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n\nInitial homeowner checks (simple, low-risk):\n1) Visually inspect the outdoor sensor location. The outdoor probe is usually mounted on an external wall or under an eaves location and is connected to the boiler by a two-core cable. Look for obvious physical damage, corrosion, or that the sensor has been painted over, buried in insulation, or covered by debris.  \n2) Check the sensor cable route and any visible connectors for looseness or damage. If the cable has been pulled off or a connector at the sensor or at the boiler end is loose, reseat the connectors (only if they are exposed and easily accessible) and try a boiler reset.  \n3) Power-cycle/reset the boiler: switch the boiler off at the isolator, wait 30 seconds, restore power and clear the fault per the boiler display/manual instructions; sometimes a transient fault will clear after a restart. If the fault returns immediately, proceed to the next checks. ([freeboilermanuals.com](https://www.freeboilermanuals.com/atag/fault-codes/?utm_source=openai))\n\nBasic diagnostic steps (if you are comfortable, but only if you can safely isolate power and have basic electrical competence):\n1) Turn off electrical supply to the boiler at the mains before opening any covers. Only remove the outer casing if you are comfortable and competent; otherwise leave this to a pro.  \n2) Locate the outdoor sensor connector on the boiler wiring harness (refer to the boiler manual or wiring diagram). Inspect the plug and socket for corrosion, bent pins, or loose wires. Re-seat the connector firmly.  \n3) With the boiler still isolated, if you have a multimeter and know how to use it, you can measure the sensor circuit for continuity and resistance: disconnect the sensor connector and measure across the two sensor wires. A healthy NTC sensor will show a finite resistance that changes when you warm or cool the sensor slightly (for example, cupping it in your hand should cause a small, noticeable change). If the meter shows open circuit (infinite resistance) or a short (near 0 ohms) the sensor or cable is likely faulty. Do not attempt repairs on internal PCB wiring — call a pro if any wiring inside the boiler looks damaged.  \n4) If the sensor wiring is open or shorted in the run, trace the cable for damage and replace or repair only if you can do so safely and maintain correct insulation and weatherproofing. If the sensor itself is faulty, replace it with the correct ATAG outdoor sensor part (match part numbers/model). After replacement, reconnect, restore power and clear the fault. Monitor the boiler to confirm the error does not return. ([freeboilermanuals.com](https://www.freeboilermanuals.com/atag/fault-codes/?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhen to call a professional (required):\n- If you cannot locate the outdoor sensor or its wiring without removing fixed fabric or cladding.  \n- If the fault persists after reseating connectors and power-cycling.  \n- If measurements indicate a problem but you are not comfortable replacing wires or probes.  \n- If the sensor and wiring appear OK but the boiler still reports the fault (possible PCB, bus communication, or control-module issue).  \nIn all of those cases, contact a qualified heating engineer or the ATAG service line. Explain you have an Error 10 (outside sensor) and describe the checks you have already done — this will speed diagnosis. Do not attempt to bypass safety sensors or modify boiler safety wiring. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))",
      "ai_overview": "Error code 10 on an ATAG boiler indicates a problem with the outside/outdoor temperature sensor (the boiler’s outdoor probe). This sensor provides the boiler controller with an outdoor temperature signal used for weather-compensated control; when the controller detects the sensor is faulty, disconnected, or out of range it will log the fault and may display code 10. The cause is commonly a disconnected or damaged sensor cable or connector, a failed NTC sensor element, or occasionally a wiring or PCB communication fault. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n\nSeverity is generally moderate: an outside sensor fault usually does not create an immediate gas safety emergency, but it does affect how the boiler controls flow temperature and can lead to poor comfort, higher fuel use, or the boiler going into a protective or degraded mode until the fault is cleared. If the fault is a simple loose connector or an obviously damaged external cable the homeowner can sometimes safely check and fix it; however, if the fault persists, or if you must open the boiler case, access the PCB, or work on internal wiring, you should call a qualified heating engineer.

      "possible_cause": "Flow sensor error",
      "troubleshooting": "Safety first\n1) Do not work on gas or mains-powered parts unless you are competent. Isolate electrical supply at the boiler isolator before any internal inspection. If you plan to isolate gas, do not relight or work on gas components unless certified—call a gas-safe/qualified technician. For ATAG boilers, the installer/service manual advises isolating supplies before servicing. ([theplumbersmate.com](https://theplumbersmate.com/installation-servicing-instructions-atag-ic-range/?utm_source=openai))\n\nInitial homeowner checks (safe, non-invasive steps you can try)\n1) Record the display and take a photo of the error and any other codes or LED patterns. This helps the technician later.\n2) Try a normal boiler reset: press the reset button or follow the boiler’s reset procedure and watch whether error 20 clears and how long the boiler runs before it returns.\n3) Check the system pressure gauge. If pressure is significantly low (many systems around 0.5–1.5 bar normal when cold depending on model), top up the central heating via the filling loop if you know how and if the manual allows; low pressure can cause circulation issues. Follow your boiler manual before filling. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n4) Look and listen: check for visible leaks around the boiler, pipework, and magnetic filters; listen for the circulation pump running when the system calls for heat (you should hear or feel vibration). Airlocks or a stalled pump can cause false sensor conditions.\n5) Bleed radiators to remove trapped air — an airbound system can give misleading flow/temperature readings that trigger faults. After bleeding, check pressure again and top up if needed. ([heliosgas.com](https://www.heliosgas.com/pages/atag-is-24-boiler-fault-codes?utm_source=openai))\n\nBasic diagnostic steps (visual and safe checks)\n1) After isolating power (only if you are comfortable doing so): open the outer casing only if you are confident and the manual doesn’t prohibit it. Do not work on live electrical parts.\n2) Visually inspect the flow-sensor cable and connector(s) where they plug into the boiler PCB or harness. Look for loose plugs, corrosion, pin damage, or crushed wires. A poorly seated connector is a common cause of short/open indications.\n3) If the connector is loose and you are competent to do so, isolate power and reseat the connector firmly, then restore power and test. If reseating fixes it, monitor the boiler to confirm the fault does not return.\n4) If the boiler has external system filters (magnetic or strainer), check them for heavy debris that could restrict flow. Cleaning a magnetic filter/screen is something many homeowners can do safely if you know the location and have a towel/container to catch water; isolate pump/power and follow the filter instructions. If you are unsure, stop and call a pro.\n\nWhen to stop and call a professional\n1) If the error returns after reset or after the simple checks above, or if you see damaged wiring or a sensor that appears faulty, stop and contact a qualified heating engineer familiar with ATAG boilers. Sensor replacement, electrical tests (measuring NTC resistance values), PCB diagnostics, or work on the pump/gas side require specialist tools and training and are normally carried out by an accredited engineer. ATAG documentation and service notes recommend technician intervention for sensor faults and internal repairs. ([manuals.plus](https://manuals.plus/m/65b73bb0bf037bce5ba1b879f5d5a5ba65b8e2f385764df0598a6d58ff67482e?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhat information to give the engineer\n1) Provide the exact fault code (20), any other codes or symbols shown, what you tried (reset, bled radiators, re-pressurised), boiler model and serial where available, and the photos you took. This speeds diagnosis.\n\nWarnings and final notes\n1) Do not attempt to replace sensors or open gas/electrical components if you are not certified; this can create safety risks and may void warranties. 2) Avoid guessing repairs—replacing parts without proper diagnostics can leave underlying faults (pump, blockage, harness fault, PCB) unresolved. 3) If in the US, contact a licensed HVAC/plumbing professional or the supplier who services ATAG products in your area; if in warranty contact ATAG support through your installer. ([theplumbersmate.com](https://theplumbersmate.com/installation-servicing-instructions-atag-ic-range/?utm_source=openai))",
      "ai_overview": "On ATAG boilers, error code 20 indicates a problem with the central heating flow sensor — the device that tells the control unit the temperature/flow condition on the boiler flow pipe. This fault usually means the control is seeing an open or shorted sensor, an out-of-range sensor reading, a loose/bad connector, or a missing/incorrect signal from the flow sensing circuit; it can also be triggered indirectly by a pump or circulation problem or blocked flow that makes the sensor reading incorrect. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n\nSeverity ranges from nuisance to system-blocking: the boiler will often go to fault or lock out the heating (and sometimes domestic hot water on combi models) until the fault is cleared because the controller can’t verify safe flow conditions. In many cases basic, non-invasive checks (reset, check system pressure, bleed air) can clear a transient fault, but diagnosing an actual sensor failure, wiring fault, pump failure, or internal electrical fault generally requires a qualified heating engineer. ATAG documentation and service guidance note that sensor faults and interventions inside the boiler should be handled by a competent engineer.

      "possible_cause": "Return sensor error",
      "troubleshooting": "Safety precautions:\n1) Before doing anything, turn off the boiler at the mains electrical isolator and, if you can safely do so, switch off the gas supply. Never work on live electrical parts inside the boiler unless you are a qualified electrician or engineer. If you are unsure, stop and call a qualified engineer.\n2) Allow the boiler and pipework to cool before touching plumbing or components to avoid burns. Wear eye protection and insulated gloves if you will be opening panels.\n3) Do not attempt to alter gas valves or burner components; any gas-related work must be done by a registered gas engineer.\n\nInitial checks a homeowner can do (non-invasive):\n1) Note the exact error code and when it appears. Consult the boiler display/user manual first for the manufacturer's recommended meaning of code 40 and any simple reset procedure.\n2) Try a controlled reset: turn the boiler off at the programmer or control panel, wait 60 seconds, then turn it back on and observe whether the error returns. If the error is intermittent and clears on reset but returns quickly, do not assume it is fixed.\n3) Check for obvious signs of water leaks, corrosion, or condensation around the boiler underside and sensor wiring entries. Moisture at connectors is a common cause.\n4) Ensure any external pipework insulation has not been disturbed and that there are no frozen pipes in cold weather around the return sensor area.\n\nSpecific diagnostic steps (some require tools and basic electrical knowledge—stop and call a pro if you are not confident):\n1) Locate the return sensor: consult the boiler manual or wiring diagram (usually inside the boiler casing or manual) to find the sensor position and the terminal on the control board. The sensor is typically fitted in the return pipe or a pocket on the hydraulic block.\n2) Visually inspect the sensor and wiring harness for loose connectors, corrosion, cracked insulation, kinks or rodent damage. Tighten any loose clips or re-seat connectors after isolating power.\n3) If you have a multimeter and are competent with it, with the boiler powered down and isolated, disconnect the sensor connector at the PCB and measure the sensor resistance. A working temperature sensor should show a stable resistance that changes with temperature (resistance falls as temperature rises for an NTC). An open-circuit (infinite resistance) or a near-zero short indicates a failed sensor or shorted wiring. Do not probe live terminals.\n4) If the sensor reads open or shorted, replace the sensor with the correct ATAG part. Use the exact replacement type specified by the manufacturer; do not substitute unknown parts. After replacement, reassemble, restore power and test.\n5) If the sensor resistance looks plausible but the boiler still reports the error, inspect the wiring back to the PCB for continuity and shorts to earth. Damaged wiring should be repaired or replaced. Again, isolate power before working on wiring.\n6) If wiring and sensor appear OK, the fault may lie with the control PCB or its sensor input circuit. At this point the issue should be diagnosed by a qualified engineer with access to service tools and spare parts.\n\nWhen to call a professional:\n1) Call a Gas Safe registered heating engineer (or equivalent local qualified technician) immediately if you find damaged gas components, cannot safely isolate the boiler, or if the fault persists after the simple checks above.\n2) If sensor replacement, wiring repair, or PCB diagnostics are required, a qualified engineer should perform these tasks. They will have the correct replacement parts, manufacturer guidance, and the legal certification to work on gas appliances.\n\nImportant notes:\n1) Do not run the boiler long-term with a known sensor fault. It can cause improper operation and may trigger safety lockouts.\n2) Do not attempt to bypass or short sensor terminals to force the boiler to run; this is unsafe and can damage the boiler or create unsafe gas conditions.\n3) Have the engineer check the entire hydraulic system and controls if the return sensor is replaced—sometimes the underlying issue is system configuration, pump failure or condensation behaviour rather than the sensor alone.\n\nIf you want, provide the boiler serial/model number and the exact wording or sequence that appears with error 40 and I can give more tailored guidance on where the return sensor is fitted and the likely wiring terminals to inspect.",
      "ai_overview": "Error code 40 on an ATAG boiler that lists a \"return sensor error\" indicates the boiler’s control electronics have detected a problem with the temperature sensor that measures the return-water temperature. The return sensor (usually an NTC thermistor) tells the boiler how warm the water coming back from the heating system is so the control can manage combustion, pump operation and frost protection. If the sensor is reading implausible values, out of range, open-circuit or shorted, the control flags the sensor fault and locks out or limits operation to prevent unsafe or inefficient running.\n\nThis fault can be caused by a failed sensor, a broken or corroded connector, damaged wiring, water ingress at the connector, or occasionally a fault on the boiler control PCB or software. Severity ranges from moderate to high: while the boiler may run in a degraded mode in some systems, an unreliable return temperature input can lead to poor control, overheating, pump cycling, condense management issues, or safety lockouts—so it should not be ignored.\n\nSome basic checks can be done by a competent homeowner (visual inspection, reset, checking wiring at easily accessible terminals), but measuring sensor resistance, working on wiring inside the boiler, or replacing components involves electrical and gas safety risks and should be carried out by a Gas Safe (or local equivalent) registered heating engineer. If simple visual checks and a reset do not clear the fault, call a qualified professional.",

      "troubleshooting": "Safety precautions:\n- If you are not experienced with gas/appliance work, stop and call a qualified technician. Working inside a boiler can be dangerous. Only do the non-intrusive checks listed below. \n- Before touching any wiring, isolate electrical power to the boiler at the fused spur or consumer unit. If you must work on low-voltage thermostat wiring, switch off the boiler’s power first. \n- Do not open the sealed combustion or gas valve area, do not alter gas pipes, and do not attempt PCB/component replacement unless you are a licensed gas/ HVAC engineer.\n\nInitial checks a homeowner can safely do:\n1) Record the exact error display and take a photo of the display/LEDs and any other codes or symptoms. This helps a technician later. \n2) Power cycle the boiler: switch the boiler off at its isolated switch or at the fused spur or trip the circuit breaker, wait about 30–60 seconds, then restore power. Some bus faults clear after a power cycle if they were caused by a temporary glitch. \n3) Check external controls: ensure room thermostats, timers, smart controllers (e.g., ATAG One) have power, are not in standby, and have good batteries where applicable. A dead thermostat or wireless controller can cause communication errors. \n4) Check visible connectors and cables that are accessible without opening the boiler: look for loose plugs, visibly damaged cable insulation, or disconnected wires at wall thermostats, external controllers, or terminal blocks. Do not touch live terminals until power is isolated. \n5) If the boiler has a visible fused spur or a small inline fuse for its controls, visually check that the fuse is intact (replace only with the correct type and rating if you are comfortable doing so and have isolated power first). \n(These initial steps are non-intrusive and widely recommended as first actions.) ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf the fault persists — diagnostic steps and what a professional will do:\n1) If power-cycling and checking external controls did not clear the code, do not continue opening the boiler. At this stage call a qualified heating engineer or licensed service technician. Explain you have a 61 bus communication error and describe the checks you have already made. \n2) A technician will first re-run the boiler’s diagnostic and logging functions (if available) to see whether the fault is intermittent or permanent and to read any stored error history. \n3) Next the engineer will isolate and test the communication links: check continuity and proper voltage on low-voltage bus wires, inspect and re-seat connectors and ribbon cables to sensors and control modules, and check for water ingress or corrosion on plugs. \n4) They will test sensors and modules (flow/return/outdoor probes, external controllers) to ensure they respond correctly; a failed sensor or shorted cable on the bus can generate a 61. \n5) If wiring and sensors are good, the technician may suspect a control PCB or communication module fault and will test or substitute components as appropriate. Many ATAG faults that persist after wiring/sensor checks are resolved by servicing or replacing the controller or connector assemblies. \n6) After any repair or reconnection the engineer will clear the fault codes, run the boiler through ignition and normal operation sequences, and monitor for reoccurrence. If the system is under warranty the repair agent will advise warranty procedures and authorised parts. ([heliosgas.com](https://www.heliosgas.com/pages/atag-ir-18-boiler-fault-codes?utm_source=openai))\n\nImportant notes and final recommendations:\n- Do not attempt gas valve, PCB or internal component replacement yourself. Those actions require a qualified, licensed technician. \n- If the boiler repeatedly shows the 61 code after basic checks and resets, arrange service promptly: repeated lockouts can leave you without heating or hot water and may mask underlying electrical faults that could worsen. \n- If your boiler is under a service contract or warranty, contact ATAG or your authorised service agent as listed in the boiler documentation. When you call a technician, give them the exact code (61), a description of any recent work or power interruptions, and the steps you tried — this saves diagnostic time.

      "ai_overview": "Error code 61 on ATAG boilers is reported by the manufacturer as a “bus communication error.” This means the boiler has detected a failure in the communication pathway (the “bus”) used by the boiler control board to talk to sensors, modules or external controllers. When that communication link is interrupted or unreliable the boiler can lose vital temperature, pressure or control information and will display the 61 fault to indicate that data exchange has failed. ([atagheating.co.uk](https://www.atagheating.co.uk/boilers-for-homeowner/support/?utm_source=openai))\n\nCommon causes include a loose or disconnected communication cable or connector, a faulty sensor or external controller (thermostat/room module), damaged wiring, or a failing control PCB (printed circuit board). The fault can be transient (for example caused by a temporary power glitch or a loose plug) or persistent (caused by damaged wiring or failed electronics). Severity ranges from an inconvenient loss of heating/hot water to a boiler lockout that prevents operation until the communication fault is cleared. Transient faults can often be cleared by safe, simple checks and resets; persistent faults often require specialist diagnostic equipment and replacement parts. ([heliosgas.com](https://www.heliosgas.com/pages/atag-ir-18-boiler-fault-codes?utm_source=openai))\n\nBecause this error concerns internal wiring and control electronics, the safe course is mixed: homeowners can perform basic, non-intrusive checks (power cycle, check external controls and visible connectors), but diagnosing and repairing wiring faults or replacing PCBs should be left to a qualified, licensed heating engineer or gas/ HVAC technician. If the boiler is under warranty or the fault repeats after simple checks, contact ATAG support or an authorised service agent.

      "troubleshooting": "Safety precautions:\n1) If you smell gas or suspect a gas leak, leave the premises immediately and contact your gas emergency number or licensed technician—do not operate electrical switches or the boiler. 2) Turn off electrical power to the boiler at the isolator before checking internal components. 3) Allow the boiler and system to cool before working on valves or radiators to avoid scalding. 4) Wear eye protection and gloves when draining water. 5) If the pressure relief valve has discharged hot water, treat that as a safety issue and call a pro.\n\nInitial checks a homeowner can do:\n1) Look at the boiler display or pressure gauge and note the pressure reading when the system is cold. Typical target pressure when cold is about 1.0–1.5 bar (many manufacturers recommend ~1.2 bar cold). When the system is hot pressure commonly rises to around 1.5–2.0 bar. If the gauge is well below 1.0 bar or above about 2.5–3.0 bar, the system is out of range. 2) Do a visual check for obvious leaks around the boiler, pipework, radiators and valves. 3) Check radiators for cold spots which can indicate air or low water level. 4) Check the filling loop (a braided hose or small pipe with one or two valves) is closed and that its connectors are secure—do not open or tamper with it if you are unsure what it is.\n\nSpecific diagnostic and practical fix steps (homeowner level):\n1) If pressure is low (for example below ~1.0 bar cold):\n   a) Locate the boiler filling loop and associated valves. On many systems it is a flexible braided hose with two isolating valves or a built-in key. If you find it and understand its operation, you may open the valves slowly to admit mains water to the system. Watch the pressure gauge and stop when the cold pressure reaches about 1.2 bar (or the value your boiler manual specifies). Close the filling valve(s) fully and make sure any removable connectors are re-fitted and secured. Re-check the gauge after a short run of the system.\n   b) After repressurising, reset the boiler following the manual (or power-cycle the boiler at the isolator for 30 seconds) and see if error 78 clears. If the pressure drops again quickly, there is likely a leak or a failing component and you must call a professional.\n2) If pressure is high (for example above ~2.5–3.0 bar):\n   a) You can lower pressure by bleeding one or more radiators (start at the lowest radiator) using a radiator key into a bowl or cloth to collect water. Open a radiator bleed valve slowly until pressure drops to the safe range (around 1.5–2.0 bar when hot, or back to ~1.2 bar cold). Close the bleed valve once done. Do not fully drain the system. Alternatively, use the boiler’s drain-off cock if you know where it is and are comfortable using it.\n   b) If the pressure relief valve has discharged water or will not stop discharging, isolate the boiler and call a qualified engineer—do not keep running the boiler.\n3) If there are visible leaks, significant or persistent loss/gain of pressure, or if the filling loop is missing/damaged, stop and call a qualified heating engineer. Likewise, if you cannot locate the filling loop, do not attempt improvised connections.\n4) If repressurising and bleeding do not clear the fault, or the boiler repeatedly returns to error 78, possible causes include a failed expansion vessel (loss of air charge), a stuck or leaking pressure relief valve, a faulty pressure transducer/sensor, or internal leaks. These require diagnostic testing (system isolation and pressure testing, checking expansion vessel pre-charge with a tyre/air gauge, replacing components) and should be done by a licensed technician.\n\nWhen to call a professional (and final notes):\n1) Call a qualified, licensed heating engineer if you are unsure about any step, if you cannot locate the filling loop, if the boiler repeatedly locks out after you repressurise, if there is visible leakage, if the pressure relief valve has operated, or if you suspect a faulty pressure sensor or expansion vessel. 2) Any work involving the gas supply, combustion components, or permanent changes to the sealed system should be performed only by a qualified technician. 3) After a professional repair, request that the engineer test system pressure, check the expansion vessel pre-charge, verify the pressure relief valve operation, and run the system to confirm the fault is cleared.\n\nDo not attempt irreversible or intrusive repairs yourself. If at any point you are uncertain, or if the boiler shows additional fault codes, contact a licensed heating engineer to avoid creating a hazardous situation.",
      "ai_overview": "Error code 78 on an ATAG boiler means the boiler has detected that the system water pressure is outside its expected range and has locked out or flagged a fault to protect the appliance. That can be either too low (loss of pressure) or too high (overpressure). Modern boilers monitor pressure with a pressure transducer; when the reading is outside safe limits the boiler will usually stop firing to avoid damage to the heat exchanger, pump, or safety valves.\n\nThis fault commonly occurs because of a slow leak in the heating system, a recently bled radiator or system top-up that wasn’t completed properly, a stuck or faulty filling loop, a failed expansion vessel or pressure relief valve, or an electrical/pressure-sensor fault. Severity is moderate to high: the boiler will normally lock out and you will lose heating/hot water until pressure is corrected. If left unaddressed a very high pressure situation can force the safety relief valve to discharge water, and persistent low pressure can cause pump damage or overheating of the boiler when it runs.\n\nSome basic corrective steps are suitable for a competent homeowner (checking the gauge, looking for leaks, repressurising the system via the filling loop if present), but other diagnostics and repairs (repairing leaks, replacing the expansion vessel, fixing the pressure relief valve, replacing the pressure transducer, or any work on the gas supply) should be performed by a qualified, licensed heating engineer. If you smell gas, see active leaks, the boiler repeatedly locks out, or you are unsure about any step, stop and call a professional immediately.",
